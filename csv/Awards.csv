Motivated by this observation, this project investigates problems of theoretical and practical significance concerning human communication networks. Typical scenarios include human-machine systems and social networks where selfish agents, some of whom are prone to bias and limitations, control nodes to manage information flow to maximize their own perceived payoff. While relevant models have been studied in the field of Behavioral Economics, their extensions to realistic communication and control settings pose many open problems.  This project will adopt a holistic approach that considers an end-to-end problem jointly from information, control, and game-theoretic perspectives, leveraging tools and models from all three disciplines. A notable application of the developed framework is on modeling public opinion polarization and misinformation spread over social networks. Another application pertains to mitigating the impact of bias in information processing systems. <br/><br/>The work will address fundamental questions regarding the emerging human communication paradigm. This growing research field requires revisiting key results in classical communication and control theories and poses significant challenges, requiring approaches and tools from multiple disciplines. The research outcomes are expected to constitute an essential step in understanding the interplay of game theory and economics with information theory, control, communications, and compression.  Specific goals of this project are categorized into three groups. The first set of goals investigates communication and compression problems between agents with misaligned objectives, cognitive limitations, and biases. The second set of goals concerns behavioral linear averaging models of opinion evolution and their applications in polarization dynamics. The final set of goals explores truthful data gathering strategies in behaviorally biased information networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Across a wide range of domains, such as healthcare, childcare, education, job training, and many others, nonprofit organizations serve the public, reduce the costs of government, and improve daily lives. Millions of individuals interact with nonprofit organizations every day. Yet despite these important roles, the high costs of collecting and sharing data have prevented a greater understanding of nonprofit organizations and their collective contributions to society. This project, the Nonprofit Organization Research Panel Project (NORPP) Manager, will create a publicly-accessible, internet-based, and collaborative research platform that will lower the costs of collecting and sharing large amounts of high-quality, multiyear data on nonprofits and their impacts. The platform will strengthen research and evaluation, broaden access to data-intensive research, and lead to more scientifically informed decision-making by organizations, policymakers, and funders and to improved outcomes for the communities they serve.<br/><br/>The NORPP platform will offer three primary functions. First, tools and automated processes will allow researchers to recruit and grow representative samples of nonprofit organizations nationally and across communities, states, and regions over time using a common methodology. The platform will automate systematic sampling and weighting procedures to ensure representativeness for studies using the platform, and it will reduce other costs to researchers by automating information flows with organizations in its samples. It will also allow public access among the research and practice communities to download nationally representative data, build additional project-specific samples within the platform, add original survey instruments, and collect original data. Second, the NORPP Manager will support the merger of data developed within the platform with IRS Form 990 Data and other available data on organizations from the population of 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations that file with the IRS, including geocoded data on organizations? communities and external environment that are publicly available from Census and other sources. Third, the NORPP Manager will serve as a collaborative repository to manage a bank of core and supplemental questionnaires to facilitate replication studies, improve content validity of measurements, and allow for consistent measurement scales across nonprofit organizational research. This work will increase the efficiency of research on nonprofit organizations by significantly reducing the costs to sample, contact, and survey nonprofit organizations, and to merge those data with existing data with the goal of facilitating the growth of rigorous, data-intensive research across the many social science disciplines that intersect with nonprofit organizational research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project traces how information spreads on social media channels and how ideas, opinions, and beliefs change as they spread.  Conducting this research requires combining concepts from computational social sciences, computer science, sociology, and statistics to understand the fundamentals of information spread in social media<br/><br/>This project develops a new approach to the study of information diffusion that brings together several different mechanisms for information flow.  Together these are used to analyze how information spreads in social media.  The research has two main goals: First, it will spot and predict opinion trends and identify users? polarization on topics of broad interest to society (e.g., climate change or the Covid-19 pandemic). Second, it will track information propagation to understand its role in shaping opinion trends and identify the factors that are important for its spread and adoption. The researchers have access to a large amount of data that permits them to build and test large-scale models of information diffusion.  The outcomes of this project include new computer algorithms that are capable of understanding information flow in social media and new avenues for research in the science of information spread and diffusion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Regions with populations with high levels of human capital are richer today, but what explains the differences in human capital between regions? Where people go and where they live determine how much human capital different places in the world have and in turn how wealthy or poor different regions are.  Regional wealth differences in the Americas depend not only on who lives there now, but also on historical patterns of migration and human capital concentration during colonial times.  This project develops a large database of where voluntary and involuntary (slaves) migrants went during colonial times.  The database will contain information about migrants? origins, measures of their human capital such as education and occupation, and map migration networks from Spain and Africa to the Americas. The database will allow researchers and others to learn what types of human capital were important and how the human capital of migrants influenced long-term economic development in different regions. <br/><br/>This project will create an open-source public database that will be available for scholars to carry out research on migration from a historical perspective in fields across the social sciences. The database will include the origins and destinations of all migrants, their physical attributes, and historical and contemporary socio-economic outcomes. Through a dedicated bilingual (English and Spanish) website, this project will provide: (i) the ability to examine data by regions over time in open-source friendly formats; (ii) historical maps with information on the main regions of origin and destination for migrants; (iii) short essays on migration flows, (iv) examples of primary sources; and (v) relevant bibliography. With this comprehensive database, researchers will be able to answer a large scope of questions about economic development in the Americas from a multidisciplinary perspective. Moreover, students and the public alike will be able to see first-hand the extraordinary flow of people that shaped the modern multicultural societies found all over the Americas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over the last 30 years, network analysis ? a method for measuring and modeling the patterns of connections between objects (people, places, proteins, etc.) ? has emerged as a prominent data-intensive research theme with broad applications and with significant Federal research investment.  Network analysis is unique amongst methodologies in its focus on interdependence, allowing investigators to understand how, for example, diseases spread through populations, hostile groups organize, or predator/prey patterns of species shape an ecosystem, as well as myriad other substantive applications.  Despite the wide use of network analysis, the analytical and computational tools are highly specialized and often have domain-specific idiosyncrasies that severely limit integration across fields and creates unnaturally high barriers to entry for investigators new to network analysis who want to apply these methods to their problems.  Moreover, current computational tools manage data in ways that make errors undetectable and easy to make, lowering rigor and reproducibility in network analysis studies.  The new computational toolkit and data storage framework developed in IDEANet aims to solve these problems through its integration of analytic methods and data archiving, discovery, and distribution. <br/><br/>To make network data easier to find, use and share, four integrated objectives are pursued in IDEANet: (1) Provision of an easy-to-use software tool, integrated via the R statistical programming language, with methodologically state-of-the-art analysis routines and metrics, developed in parallel with a ShinyR app that allows GUI use for R novices; (2) Construction of a network data translation engine that allows users to easily move data between the myriad extant formats found across application fields; (3) Provision of a core metrics compute engine that automatically generates vetted best practice metrics on network data of multiple types; (4) Development of a data repository and archival system that leverages the compute tools to build harmonized network data releases in multiple formats with pre-computed summary statistics and metrics, tailored to different levels of security.  The secure-data archive capacity makes use of ImPACT (Infrastructure for Privacy-Assured CompuTations) distributed secure data services developed under prior NSF investment (#1659367).

Was the shift to agricultural societies the cause of this population growth? This project proposes a large-scale quantitative examination of the demographic consequences of this worldwide agricultural revolution. The investigators will develop a new statistical framework that jointly infers prehistoric population growth from genetic and archeological data in order to test a long-standing hypothesis suggesting that the transition to agriculture spurred rapid human population growth because of stable food sources and sedentism. The project will develop interdisciplinary methods and open-access software that can be used by geneticists, archeologists, paleontologists, and others interested in prehistory. The project also will support hands-on boot-camps in statistical methods and data analysis for upper level undergraduates and early graduate students, and train two interdisciplinary graduate students in quantitative methods, focusing on integration of large-scale genomic and archeological data, as well as software development. <br/><br/>This proposal develops a novel method to infer population history, combining next generation sequence data with large archeological datasets, including important developments in computational archaeology. Incorporation of data from multiple fields allows for higher resolution inferences, and tests for concordance between disciplines. The method will then be applied to study one of the most impactful events in human history: the agricultural transition, testing classic hypotheses about the massive social and demographic rearrangements thought to accompany the shift to agriculture using new large-scale databases. Comparisons between multiple continents will provide independent tests of the consequences of the agricultural transition, while also providing novel insight into the population histories of understudied regions of the world. The method will be of use to researchers in a range of fields as these types of big datasets become increasingly common.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Kinship has been shown to be particularly important in providing support to migrants, and migrants, in turn, send money to relatives back home, but the typical methods used to study contemporary migration cannot show its long-term effects upon kin networks in space. Data at a larger temporal and spatial scale are needed. This project creates a population-scale family tree dataset which links about forty million people in crowd-sourced family trees to their common ancestors. The research will use these data to study how migration influenced the geographic proximity of kin over centuries. This project contributes to the development of globally competitive STEM workforce by training graduate, undergraduate and high school students in the areas of human networks and data science. It develops an online visual storytelling and education tool to communicate how migrations form cultural and demographic structures. This tool, which is being developed through a collaboration with high school social studies teachers, has the potential to increase public scientific literacy about and engagement in the study of migration and kinship networks.<br/><br/>This research compares the spatial evolution of kinship networks under different conditions to test theories about how and when different types of networks emerge, stagnate, and, ultimately, disappear, showing how those networks change as a result of a variety of economic and demographic circumstances. The project links information such as occupation, household composition, and fine-scale locations of residences from the historical census data to the family trees. This data can then be used to characterize kinship networks and their evolution over geographic space and time. This research helps reveal the conditions that favor the development of large aggregations of related families, and those that favor dispersion. Specifically, this project assesses how much migration contributed to the development of different types of networks and how this relationship changed as different locations were settled by different groups. This research helps bridge the gap between geographic information science and social network analysis by developing new measures, models, and visualization techniques for studying the relationship between kinship networks and migration. The data will allow researchers to study how the proximity of family members influences a variety of other long-term multi-generational outcomes such as income inequality, social mobility, and health. A better understanding of the forces that transform kinship networks and methods for describing them helps anticipate changes in the present and future, such as the extent to which elderly or vulnerable populations can rely on kin nearby for support.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Particularly, in seemingly merit-based institutions, tracing these networks could reveal the unequal structures in which diverse populations experience systemic disparities. The American legal profession offers a useful site to track these processes of inequality because it remains unequal despite its increasing heterogeneity. Law students, like many professionals, are encouraged frequently to ?network,? but students from a range of diverse backgrounds ? including race, gender, sexual orientation, national status, and class ? may have access to differentially resourced social networks, or social capital. These ?network inequalities? may impact the value of legal education across differentially structured groups of students and ultimately shape differences in student experiences and career outcomes. Whereas research on the legal profession has highlighted the importance of social capital and relationships to promote careers, less attention has been paid to the nature of networks in early professional socialization. Particularly, while the research is rife with accounts about the racial, gendered, and nationality differences during law school and then, much later, during different career stages, not enough is known about the temporal experience of law school as it feeds into the transitional period between law school and the first years of professional careers. This period is important because it tracks the emergence of a path dependency that can serve diverse professionals differently and unequally even as it structurally seems equitable.<br/><br/>Following an earlier longitudinal network and interview study of a cohort of first-year law students across three law schools, the research aims to examine the same law students? social networks with a range of actors to evaluate the importance of social ties for the school-to-work transition in the legal profession. The project will investigate whether observed network inequalities can account for differential job market outcomes across diverse categories of students, as well as different outcomes at the end of students? law school careers. This innovative, longitudinal dataset will provide insight into the role that network inequalities play in shaping not only variation in experiences across different groups of students, but ultimately the role that these structural inequalities play in producing differential pathways into the legal profession. Further, given the timing of the data, it will also provide a unique opportunity to observe student experiences disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the focus of this project is inequality in law schools and early legal careers, the relevance of our findings may extend beyond the legal profession, as well, to organizations struggling with similar dynamics, including non-law professional organizations and educational organizations, for example. Specifically, these findings may provide opportunities to create meaningful interventions that may mitigate existing inequalities and facilitate more equal outcomes within the legal profession and beyond.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Analyzing these structures can tell us who is well-connected, who is important in the network, and more advanced structural properties like how information will flow through the network. Yet, these analyses are typically conducted without references to where the network is located in geographic space. Mapping the locations of the people or organizations (nodes) in a social network and the relationships between them (edges) allows us to measure new properties such as obstacles to meeting, important nearby facilities, and paths of knowledge and information flow across space. Using models, technologies and methods from Geographic Information Science (GIS) and Social Network Analysis (SNA), the project will create a public Spatial Social Network (SSN) data repository that includes SSNs from a wide variety of subjects including epidemiology, sociology, anthropology, history, political science, organization science, and public health. In addition to the data, the project will develop new models and statistical tests to help better understand these networks. To help promote and communicate the study of SSNs, the investigator will lead the development of educational and research infrastructure through software, tutorials, curriculum guidance and the support of an online community of SSN researchers. <br/><br/>This Faculty Early-Career Development (CAREER) award will support the investigation of how the features of the built environment and physical environment play a role in how social networks form and develop, and the relationships that ensue within the provisions of geographic space. The investigator will fuse both SNA and GIS principles by measuring node and graph properties, and linking these properties to environmental features for simultaneous assessment (e.g. hot spots and network centrality). She will compare real SSNs to simulations of those networks based on principles of movement, distance decay, city formation and the urban hierarchy, as well as social network characteristics such as preferential attachment, structural holes and small-world models. This research will show how choices in scale, scope, sampling, and simplification affect statistical results, and design best practices for analyzing and modeling social networks in geographic space. The project will contribute to improving models used in the physical sciences by incorporating features of places, land use, topography, points of interest, administrative districts, population density, and transportation features. This project also emphasizes the visualization of SSNs on maps, which helps both exploratory spatial data analysis and engagement with a broad audience. The expected outcomes are innovative methods for testing how social networks interact with their surroundings, and a new understanding of how and why individuals or groups form relationships with one another in the context of their surroundings and provisions of the built environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Global trade can provide foods at lower prices, supply more types of foods year-round, and resist local supply shortages, such as crop failures. At the same time, global trade has drawbacks and can pose a risk to food security. For example, environmental disasters can create supply shortages that are passed on to importing countries or nutritious foods can be redirected away from domestic markets. Seafood is an important source of nutrition around the world and is among the most highly traded foods. As a result, it is important to understand when global seafood trade either improves or threatens food and nutrition security. This grant supports the construction of a database that tracks the flows of products in the global seafood market. The database includes information on the kinds of seafood that are being traded across countries, who is selling it and who is buying it, and how this network of buyers and sellers changes over time. <br/> <br/>This project constructs the Aquatic Resource Trade in Species (ARTIS) database which shows the global flow of seafood species for the first time. This database enables research on the environmental and human outcomes of food system globalization, including a better understanding of the conditions under which trade promotes environmental sustainability, human health, and food security. Research in these areas has been limited by missing data and, for the data that exist, mismatches in the taxonomic and product resolution of the data. The ARTIS database uses techniques of optimization to align public data sets. These linked datasets are joined to new data on the nutrient content of different kinds of seafood. ARTIS is available to researchers through published underlying data and code and a downloadable R package that archives the data and code.

Spoken language use reflects many factors, including cognitive constraints on production and perception of sound, speech community membership, and cultural practices, among others. This study models the interrelationships between these factors and participation in regional sound changes or resistance to change, bilectal use of mainstream English together with a heritage language variety used in the local speech community, or monolectal use of an ethnic variety of English. The study site is Washington state. Unlike many places in the United States where ethnic groups settled into small communities with relatively insular social networks (resulting in the famous ethnic enclaves of the East coast and Inland North), the Pacific Northwest has long been characterized by regional and social mobility. The notion of ""community"" itself is complex, but requires better understanding as non-white, mobile individuals become a larger part of the US population. This study also uses practice-based, rather than assignment-based methods for determining ethnic group membership. General practice in the language sciences in North America has been to sample primarily from majority-ethnicity groups in a speech community. The assumption taken has been that non-white speakers do not participate in regional sound changes, but are embedded in separate speech communities defined by shared ethnic identity. While partly true, this assumption has been shown to be a vast oversimplification. There is scholarship showing that speakers' use of ethnolectal forms is not predicted by race as much as by social network composition. But complex social models need to be better-integrated into linguistic research. Race has been conflated with ethnicity, for one thing. Race (physical appearance or genetic heritage), rather than ethnicity (cultural heritage, practice, and perceived affiliation) has been used as an initial tool for constructing research samples, leading to a priori determinations about speech community membership.  <br/><br/>This project utilizes social network measures of localness of affective network, homophily (similarity-based affiliation), network range, and referential network.  Linguistic data are drawn from vowel system recordings and measures of the acoustic cues to phonetic production, focusing on sets of features known to be associated with mainstream as well as local dialects. Spoken data provide the stimuli for cross-dialect testing of listener sensitivity to fine-grained, time-varying differences in sound. The result is a model of participation in linguistic change relevant for mobile, non-white Pacific Northwest speakers, contributing to sociolinguistic theorization of dialect evolution and interethnic contact, as well as listeners' use of social information in the perception of phonetic variation.  The study involves collaboration between researchers at the University of Washington, and Heritage University, located on Yakama First Nation lands in Toppenish, Washington.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over the last 30 years, network analysis ? a method for measuring and modeling the patterns of connections between objects (people, places, proteins, etc.) ? has emerged as a prominent data-intensive research theme with broad applications and with significant Federal research investment.  Network analysis is unique amongst methodologies in its focus on interdependence, allowing investigators to understand how, for example, diseases spread through populations, hostile groups organize, or predator/prey patterns of species shape an ecosystem, as well as myriad other substantive applications.  Despite the wide use of network analysis, the analytical and computational tools are highly specialized and often have domain-specific idiosyncrasies that severely limit integration across fields and creates unnaturally high barriers to entry for investigators new to network analysis who want to apply these methods to their problems.  Moreover, current computational tools manage data in ways that make errors undetectable and easy to make, lowering rigor and reproducibility in network analysis studies.  The new computational toolkit and data storage framework developed in IDEANet aims to solve these problems through its integration of analytic methods and data archiving, discovery, and distribution. <br/><br/>To make network data easier to find, use and share, four integrated objectives are pursued in IDEANet: (1) Provision of an easy-to-use software tool, integrated via the R statistical programming language, with methodologically state-of-the-art analysis routines and metrics, developed in parallel with a ShinyR app that allows GUI use for R novices; (2) Construction of a network data translation engine that allows users to easily move data between the myriad extant formats found across application fields; (3) Provision of a core metrics compute engine that automatically generates vetted best practice metrics on network data of multiple types; (4) Development of a data repository and archival system that leverages the compute tools to build harmonized network data releases in multiple formats with pre-computed summary statistics and metrics, tailored to different levels of security.  The secure-data archive capacity makes use of ImPACT (Infrastructure for Privacy-Assured CompuTations) distributed secure data services developed under prior NSF investment (#1659367).

To gain a deeper understanding of how children develop and how this development can vary across children, it is important to have a large and diverse sample of children participate in multiple studies over time. Unfortunately, due to challenges with current in-person methods, much of the previous research on children has small samples, with limited diversity, and with limited opportunities for the same children to participate in multiple studies as they age. This project will address these limitations by collecting data with a large and diverse sample in many studies over time. To do so, it will be a collaboration across multiple universities in which families participate conveniently at home, over the internet.<br/><br/>This research will present parents with a family-friendly website where their child will be able to participate in research studies online from home and will enable them to learn more about developmental science. Using this approach, researchers will be able to design and conduct online studies as well as share data. The collected data will involve large-scale replication and extension of several classic measures of cognitive development related to thinking and reasoning in children ages 3 to 6, and will integrate new experimental studies into the infrastructure to understand how generalizable past findings are and how behavior on one task relates to others. In subsequent phases of this project, scholars outside of the project?s initial collaborative network will be invited to use the infrastructure for their own research and will be able to use the initial data to guide new research questions. The results will have implications for improving theoretical models of cognitive development and education and launch discipline-wide opportunities for innovative, representative, and open research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These censuses generate information about who people are, their education, and where they work and live. Census data are important for understanding how human populations change over time. However, most of these data are found only in printed volumes on library shelves. It is challenging to get data from printed pages ready for analysis, so these data are difficult to use for research. This project will collect census volumes; scan the data inside; convert the data into digital formats that are easy to analyze; and make them freely available to researchers worldwide. Making these data easy to access will allow researchers, policy makers, and others to answer questions about important issues like aging, migration, fertility, and mortality. <br/><br/>This project builds on work that created the IPUMS International Historical Geographic Information System (IHGIS). IHGIS software currently works to process and document data from PDF documents. This project extends the IHGIS tools to work with print volumes by using optical character recognition to convert scanned images into digital data tables. To do so, special problems related to scanning data tables are addressed. For example, there is no way to tell from the number itself that a scanned 3,222 should be 8,222 instead. This project develops software to determine the right value; for example, using a digitized table, the software might determine consistency, within a given age group, among the number of people attending school, the number of people not attending school, and the total number of people in the age group to determine the correct 8,322 value. More complicated problems arise with multidimensional tables, such as a table that contains the levels of education attained for people in different age groups across many different geographic regions. The software uses structured information about the content of tables to determine consistency across specific row and column elements and performs the checks to find scanning errors. Automating otherwise labor-intensive problems like these will provide a large collection of data for countries and time periods where digitally published data are not available. Thanks to the geographic detail, historical depth, and global coverage, researchers will be able to use the data to study change over time and differences between places within and between countries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hubs participate widely across a diverse set of cognitive functions. Because of their widespread connections, hubs are well positioned to link functions across the brain as needed for executive and task control (the ability to flexibly guide thoughts and actions depending on our goals). Task control is vitally important for achieving both short-term goals (e.g., waking up early and carrying out a morning routine to get to work on time) and long-term goals (e.g., studying rules of the road and practicing supervised driving in order to learn how to drive and obtain a driver?s license) in everyday life. Task control requires that the brain flexibly coordinate relevant sensory, motor and cognitive functions to achieve those goals. This research explores how hub regions of the brain help to organize and coordinate these task control functions.<br/><br/>Network neuroscience methods, based on non-invasive human neuroimaging data (using fMRI ? functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging), can be used to identify, and elucidate the connectivity of brain hub regions. Prior work has shown that damage to these hub regions leads to widespread brain disconnections, and has a powerful impact on behavior and on brain interactions. However, the functional role of brain hubs in task control is still poorly understood, in terms of their specificity across task contexts and their role in representing task information. This research explores how and when brain hubs are used in different behavioral contexts and across multiple tasks in healthy subjects, and investigates the impact of individual differences in hub organization. This project uses fMRI to measure the connectivity, and task-related activation of hubs, in three inter-related research objectives to: (1) determine how hubs modulate information flow across diverse task contexts and task difficulty levels, (2) determine whether and with what specificity hubs represent task parameters, and (3) determine whether individual differences in hub organization relate to individual differences in task control functions. This investigation deepens our understanding of the functional role of hubs - leading to potential future insights into how brain hubs may be targeted to improve goal achievement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Observations made on samples collected in the field and in the laboratory constitute a critical data resource for research that addresses grand challenges of our planet's future sustainability, from environmental change; to food, energy, and water resources; to natural hazards and their mitigation; to public health. The large investments of public funds being made to curate huge volumes of samples acquired over decades or even centuries, and to collect and analyze new samples, demand that these samples be openly accessible, easily discoverable, and documented with sufficient information to make them reusable. The current ecosystem of sample and sample data management in the U.S. and globally is highly fragmented across stakeholders, including museums, federal agencies, academic institutions, and individual researchers, with a multitude of institutional and discipline-specific catalogs, practices for sample identification, and protocols for describing samples. The iSamples project is a multi-disciplinary collaboration that will develop a national digital infrastructure to provide services for globally unique, consistent, and convenient identification of material samples; metadata about them; and linking them to other samples, derived data, and research results published in the literature. iSamples builds on previous initiatives to achieve these goals by providing material samples with globally unique, persistent identifiers that reliably link to landing pages with metadata describing the sample and its provenance, and which allow unambiguously linking samples with data and publications. Leveraging significant national investments, iSamples provides the missing link among (i) physical collections (e.g., natural history museums, herbaria, biobanks), (ii) field stations, marine laboratories, long-term ecological research sites, and observatories, and (iii) data repositories and cyberinfrastructure. iSamples delivers enhanced infrastructure for STEM research and education, decision-makers, and the general public. iSamples benefits national security and resource management by offering a means to assure sample provenance, improving scientific reproducibility and demonstrating compliance with ethical standards, national regulations, and international treaties.<br/><br/>The Internet of Samples (iSamples) is a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional project to design, develop, and promote service infrastructure to uniquely, consistently, and conveniently identify material samples, record metadata about them, and persistently link them to other samples and derived digital content, including images, data, and publications. The project will create a flexible and scalable architecture to ensure broad adoption and implementation by diverse stakeholders. iSamples will build upon existing identifier infrastructure such as IGSNs (Global Sample Number;) and ARKs (Archival Resource Keys), but is agnostic to identifier type. Likewise, iSamples will encourage a high-level metadata standard for natural history samples (across biosciences, geosciences, and archaeology), while supporting community-developed metadata standards in specialist domains. Through integration with established discipline-specific infrastructure at the System for Earth Sample Registration SESAR (geoscience), CyVerse (bioscience), and Open Context (archaeology), iSamples will extend existing capabilities, enhance consistency, and expand their reach to serve science and society much more broadly. The project includes three main objectives: 1) Design and develop iSamples infrastructure (iSamples in a Box and iSamples Central); 2) Build four initial implementations of iSamples for adoption and use case testing (Open Context, GEOME, SESAR, and Smithsonian Institution); and 3) Conduct outreach and community engagement to developers, individual researchers, and international organizations concerned with material samples.

As populations around the world face growing pressure from climate change, the risk of environmental catastrophe, depletion of local resources, and conflict between groups increases. Yet, social relationships can supply resources for day-to-day survival, such as food, money, and physical assistance. Social relationships that cross groups may be especially important in times of stress because they provide access to crucial resources that cannot be obtained locally. The social relationships a person has are shaped by the groups a person belongs to, such as their household or neighborhood, and by their personal characteristics such as their age or gender, as well as the relationships they have with others. <br/><br/>To better understand how between-group relationships develop and function, this project studies multilevel networks of friendship and social support in two adjacent but culturally distinct populations. The project collects data on how these networks develop and evolve over time. It also collects data on individual characteristics, such as age, gender, and status to understand how personal characteristics shape social relationships. Bringing together theory and data from anthropology, network science, and sociology, this project uses network models to identify the factors that encourage relationships between these two populations, including factors that promote resilience in the face of limited resources. The project uses state-of-the-art simulation-based methods to analyze data at the level of individuals and at the level of groups, combining several sources of data to learn about how network structure and individual and group characteristics are related to the mechanisms of relationship-building. In doing so, this work tells us how individuals build and leverage relationships that provide access to supportive resources within and beyond their communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Social media sites are not homogeneous; they are made up of online ?foci? of interaction -- online communities like groups, blogs, and discussion forums characterized by their stability and bounded nature. In certain foci, conversations are friendly and constructive, in others, hostile and unproductive. The goal of this study is to understand how the different characteristics of online foci ? their cultures, moderation policies, attitudes towards outsiders, and social relationships ? influence the quality of their conversations. Findings will advance scientific knowledge to improve a democratic society and help scholars and practitioners imagine and design a more inclusive and democratic online public sphere.<br/><br/>This study leverages a large-scale multilevel dataset that covers all public conversations that unfolded during a major campaign across 1,058 topical forums on a popular platform. The data consist of 1.2 billion comments, 8.2 billion reactions to posts, and 2.6 billion reactions to comments among three hundred million users across 7.5 million posts.  In addition, the project collects labeled comments to train machine learning models that measure and predict whether comments are deliberative according to two core dimensions: the civility of conversations and meaningful cross-ideological interactions. These data, in conjunction with recent methodological advances in the analysis of quasi-experimental designs, social network analysis, natural language processing, and multilevel modeling strategies, are used to identify the characteristics of online foci that foster cross-ideological interaction and civil discourse and to understand the role online foci play in moderating the impact of divisive, exogenous social events.

Through multiple collections, researchers now have access to two billion census records describing the entire American population from the mid-nineteenth century to the present day. Although these data collections have rich research potential, the massive scale and scope of the data poses new challenges for researchers. The Network will address these challenges by building an open interdisciplinary community of researchers. It will connect these researchers through online communication and in-person meetings, including four annual research conferences. It will lower barriers to research by creating working groups to provide training and guidance. The Network also will conduct outreach to new community members, including annual training workshops. Outreach efforts will focus on scholars from underrepresented groups, early career scholars, and those outside major research institutions. The Network will directly contribute to the training of underrepresented graduate and undergraduate students through participation in the institution's Summer Diversity Fellowship program. Leveraging the broad experiences and expertise of the research community, the Network will attract new scholars to these valuable data resources, enabling new research.<br/><br/>The Big Microdata Network will support an emerging interdisciplinary community of scientists using vast collections of census microdata describing the American population from the mid-nineteenth century to the present day. It will leverage previous federal investment in massive census data collections which describe the American population. The IPUMS full-count census collection provides consistently coded data from 1850 to 1940 from census records that have been released publicly following the 72-year requirement. The Federal Statistical Research Data Centers provide access to decennial census data for 1960 to 2010 under appropriate data security measures. Some researchers, however, lack the computing power necessary to take advantage of these data, and even those with sufficient resources still require new programming strategies to manipulate and analyze data of this scale. Record linkage poses a host of problems, from analytic decisions to computational capacity. Investigators working to exploit geographic detail also face considerable startup costs for geocoding, developing GIS boundary files, and conceptualizing new geographic measures of neighbors and neighborhoods. Restrictions around data access pose constraints for sharing resources and present difficulties for data replication and preservation. By increasing access and lowering barriers to using these data, the Network will help researchers overcome these challenges. It will advance scholarship across a range of fields, including economics, sociology, demography, statistics, geography, epidemiology, urban planning, and public policy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, these data contain identifying information that, if made available to the public, could be dangerous or embarrassing to the people involved.  It is important, therefore, to find ways that scientists can conduct the research necessary to learn about what causes society?s ills and how to fix them without violating anyone?s individual privacy.  This project builds open source, community-based software tools that will let scientists safely access, analyze, and share sensitive datasets, with mathematical guarantees for the privacy of the individuals who may be represented in those datasets. <br/><br/>The project is based on the mathematical theory of differential privacy, which changes the data in a way that hides individual-level information. Even though the individual-level information is hidden, differential privacy still allows researchers to study the population-level patterns in the data.  The project builds user-friendly, publicly available interactive differential privacy tools that can integrate with widely used data repositories.  These tools can be effectively employed even by those without expertise in differential privacy.  The project also creates new statistical methods that ensure that the tools are useful for social, behavioral, and economic research.

Because these forces present both opportunities and challenges, the path forward in how to make a living is often uncertain. Is it better to give up farming, move to an urban area, become a wage-laborer, leave family behind, and sever ties with one?s birth community? How do these decisions affect the wellbeing of families? This project examines how small-scale farmers navigate these decisions. Specifically, the researchers collect new data to assess whether the reliance on family versus formal institutions for social support is influenced by household economic decisions, and what impact this has on the wellbeing of rural families when faced with the dual challenge of increasing environmental variability and globalization. The project provides scientific and STEM-field research experience to undergraduate and graduate students and professional training to postdoctoral researchers, as well as valuable information for non-governmental organizations and policy makers.<br/><br/>This research provides a novel test of economic, sociological, and cultural anthropological theories to address the extent to which opportunities associated with market transition trade off as they interact with environmental variability to affect farmers? livelihoods. Using a longitudinal design, ethnographic, and cutting-edge social network methods, the researchers aim to characterize (1) how social relationships and economic activities are affected by market transition over time; and (2) how reliance on relationships versus labor market participation are associated with health and well-being. The researchers investigate further the extent to which climate variables affect people's social relationships, economic activities, and daily lives, creating much-needed links between social and climate science. Finally, the research provides validity tests and other tools to meet the stated needs of Vulnerability Assessments required by policy makers and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) involved in economic development. Together, findings from the research will provide pertinent insight into the scale at which climate and market variables together affect human behavior and how farmers manage changes in their social, economic, and ecological environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These articulatory habits differ between individuals, and across languages and dialects of the same language, accounting for many aspects of foreign accent, speech disorders and speaking style.  Whereas previous studies of these habits have required specialized equipment for the immediate observation of articulator movements, the aim of this project is to develop and improve a tool for ""speech inversion""--that is, a tool that can accurately recover articulatory movements directly from the acoustic speech signal using machine learning methods.  To date, the tool developed by the project team has successfully recovered movements of the tongue and lips; the current project extends the tool?s functionality to encompass nasality (soft palate) and voicing (glottis).  Training and validation of the extended system will proceed using a newly collected corpus of acoustic and articulatory data drawn from speakers of American English.  This corpus, comprising co-collected audio, nasal, voicing, and articulatory movement, will serve as 'ground truth' for training and assessing the capabilities of the fully trained speech inversion system.  As a further test, we will test it against ground truth data from speakers of languages with patterns of articulatory habits known to differ from English.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop and refine a Speech Inversion Tool that 'reads' acoustic recordings of speech and 'recovers' details of the magnitude and timing of articulatory movements.  The project aims to accomplish this goal by training specialized Neural Network models to relate features of the acoustic signal to separately acquired ground-truth nasal vs. oral outflow signals and concurrent electroglottography. Training data derives from native speakers of English; validation and tests for generalization include productions of speakers of Canadian French and Russian. When successfully validated, the resulting speech inversion tool will be useful for identifying medical issues that affect speech movement organization, such as the well-known disruption of oral/laryngeal timing in speakers with dysarthria. In addition, incorporating estimates of articulation may also aid in the tracking of changes resulting from medical conditions such as depression and schizophrenia.  More generally, the ability to rapidly and easily analyze articulatory movements obtained from audio recordings alone has the potential substantially improve Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, and to assist scholars, forensic scientists, and clinical professionals studying the speech of communities under field conditions in rural or under-resourced areas, and to help in the documentation of endangered languages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This effort is driven by the desires to better understand human cognition, and to build better language technologies. This project draws on the theories and methods of both linguistics and computer science to study the learning of word stress, the pattern of relative prominence of the syllables in a word. The stress systems of the world's languages are relatively well described, and there are competing linguistic theories of how they are represented. This project applies learning methods from computer science to find new evidence to distinguish the competing linguistic theories. It also examines systems of language representation that have been developed in computer science and have received relatively little attention by linguists (neural networks). The research will engage undergraduate and graduate linguistics students at a public university. Linguistics has a much higher proportion of female students than computer science, and this project aims to address gender imbalance in STEM.  <br/><br/>From a linguistic perspective, learning stress involves learning hidden structure, parts of the representation that are not present in the observed data and that must be inferred by the learner. A given pattern of prominence over syllables is often consistent with multiple prosodic representations. The approach to hidden structure learning used in this project applies the general technique of Expectation Maximization, which in pilot work achieved good results on a standard test set. Intriguingly, many of the languages that this learner failed on in the test set are ones that are in fact cross-linguistically unattested. This project expands the set of tested languages to include more of the range of systems found cross-linguistically, and further explores the possibility that typological gaps have learning explanations. It compares hypotheses about the constraints responsible for stress placement by comparing how well they support the learning of attested systems, and whether they can help explain typological gaps.

In particular, the research examines the ways that individuals and households leverage their social networks to buffer livelihood risks and realize economic opportunities. This award supports longitudinal fieldwork in a diverse sample of small communities, where collaborators collect standardized data on variables such as material wealth, social networks, demographics, educational attainment, food security, and kinship relationships. The comparative findings contribute to interdisciplinary scholarship on the processes that lead to wealth inequality and the consequences of inequality for economic livelihoods and related outcomes, such as food security. The project supports work and training among diverse collaborators, including women, underrepresented minorities, and early-career researchers, contributing to the goals of broadening participation in science. The findings are shared with local communities and with broader audiences via educational modules in open-access economics courses. The methodological tools being developed for the project can facilitate similar comparative studies.<br/><br/>This collaborative project examines the dynamic social processes that contribute to material wealth inequality. The research includes data collection in over forty communities that vary in terms of subsistence orientations, political organization, kinship and descent, and demographics. The research design focuses in general on the economic consequences of variation in the structure of social support networks. In particular, the study shows the extent to which advantageous positions in community networks can mitigate economic risks and enable material gains. Simultaneously, the researchers collect and analyze data on other variables that are hypothesized to effect dynamic variation in material wealth, including variation in education and skills, occupations and status, and family structures. These data contribute to comparative analyses that consider the relative effects of these variables on changes in material wealth and inequality. The findings have relevance for debates about the determinants and consequences of wealth inequality in both historical and contemporary societies. Methodologically, approaches for organizing and analyzing longitudinal data are being developed and shared across research communities to build capacity for similar multi-sited projects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How does insurgent violence change in response to civilian casualties? And how do large-scale aid programs affect the frequency, type, and location of insurgent violence in these settings? These questions are examples of important issues that face policy-makers on a daily basis. Yet while the study of human dynamics of violence has grown enormously over the past decade, we still lack methods for conducting causal inference in these challenging settings. Indeed, scholars have continued to rely on approaches that do not fully account for the spatial and temporal dynamics that characterize fast-moving interactions between governments, insurgents, and civilians. Existing methods typically aggregate fine-grained geo-spatial data at much coarser temporal and spatial units, throwing away the advantages of current micro-level data and leaving scholars unable to capitalize on future improvements to high-frequency, high-resolution geo-spatial data. Taken together, existing frameworks risk mistaken causal inferences about the efficacy of both violent and non-violent interventions in these settings, leaving policy-makers blind to possible unintended consequences and negative externalities of proposed policies.<br/><br/>This project will develop a comprehensive spatio-temporal causal inference framework that avoids data aggregation and imposes no structural assumptions on spatial spillover and temporal carryover effects. It defines causal quantities of interest under stochastic interventions, which represent counterfactual treatment assignment strategies. The estimation strategy employs inverse probability weighting based on an estimated propensity score surface. Among others, this project will develop mediation analysis, effect modification, and sensitivity analysis for these complex spatio-temporal settings. It will also investigate other important problems such as optimal treatment allocations, the spatial range of treatment spillover, and causal inference in the presence of persistent treatments. This project team will use airstrikes and economic assistance in fragile settings as empirical examples. The goal is to publish articles in leading general science, statistical, and political science journals. The PIs will also publish software packages to automate and to extend the spatio-temporal framework to other issues and settings.

However, many of these systems are increasingly threatened by climate extremes, including drought, and pest outbreaks such as locust plagues, which threaten agricultural productivity. As a result of these cumulative stressors, these regions are experiencing increasing conflicts with global geopolitical significance. This project aims to support landscape management approaches that enhance human and environmental well-being in agropastoral systems. The results of this project are intended to advance understanding of what landscape patterns, processes, and ecosystem services best promote regenerative capacity under contemporary and future stressors. This research also provides educational opportunities for underrepresented students, advances a citizen science app to monitor agricultural health, and promotes partnerships among scholars and practitioners to better understand and support landscape-level decision making.<br/><br/>This research builds upon conceptual models and techniques from multiple sub-disciplines of geography (landscape ecology, remote sensing, land change science) and related frameworks (socio-ecological systems, and resilience). The research develops the concept of regenerative landscape design, in which landscape patterns and processes can be more purposely designed to lead to more desirable futures. Using case studies that span broad gradients in historical land tenure policies, biophysical settings, and contemporary or future stressors, this research explores the challenges and opportunities of landscape change and advances understanding of household adaptive capacity in the context of these historical, contemporary, and future landscape patterns. A better understanding of household and landscape level regenerative capacity can enhance agricultural and pastoral productivity and help guide landscape-level policies that support human well-being.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, gender disparities continue to exist in academic science around the world, both in the quantity and in the impact of research output. In the decade after 2000, male researchers, on average, published 35% more papers and received 34% more citations than female researchers. These gender gaps are even wider in the United States than the global average. Understanding causes of persistent gender gaps in research is of grave significance for improving gender equality in academic institutions. The current project is an interdisciplinary effort to address this question and advance knowledge across multiple fields, including psychology, sociology, organizational behavior, human resource management, and scientometrics. It will propose a novel theory that integrates existing perspectives and test it using a big data approach.<br/><br/>Specifically, the project investigates topic fit (i.e., the degree of subject topic similarity or congruence between any new collaboration and a researcher?s existing work) as a key mechanism for understanding gender gaps in research productivity and impact. Drawing upon Social Role Theory, it is theorized that gender role norms and expectations may lead female and male scholars to have different collaboration patterns with junior researchers and lower levels of topic fit for women, which, in turn, would explain a productivity penalty for women. The investigators are analyzing publication records of over 90 million researchers around the world, computing topic fit indices using novel methods, and testing these indices as a critical mechanism for explaining gender gaps using both path analysis at the individual researcher level and multilevel modeling to account for the nested structure of the data. Importantly, the project also examines differences across academic disciplines and analyzes trends over time. Findings can inform institutional policies and practices for advancing gender equality in academic science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Across a wide range of domains, such as healthcare, childcare, education, job training, and many others, nonprofit organizations serve the public, reduce the costs of government, and improve daily lives. Millions of individuals interact with nonprofit organizations every day. Yet despite these important roles, the high costs of collecting and sharing data have prevented a greater understanding of nonprofit organizations and their collective contributions to society. This project, the Nonprofit Organization Research Panel Project (NORPP) Manager, will create a publicly-accessible, internet-based, and collaborative research platform that will lower the costs of collecting and sharing large amounts of high-quality, multiyear data on nonprofits and their impacts. The platform will strengthen research and evaluation, broaden access to data-intensive research, and lead to more scientifically informed decision-making by organizations, policymakers, and funders and to improved outcomes for the communities they serve.<br/><br/>The NORPP platform will offer three primary functions. First, tools and automated processes will allow researchers to recruit and grow representative samples of nonprofit organizations nationally and across communities, states, and regions over time using a common methodology. The platform will automate systematic sampling and weighting procedures to ensure representativeness for studies using the platform, and it will reduce other costs to researchers by automating information flows with organizations in its samples. It will also allow public access among the research and practice communities to download nationally representative data, build additional project-specific samples within the platform, add original survey instruments, and collect original data. Second, the NORPP Manager will support the merger of data developed within the platform with IRS Form 990 Data and other available data on organizations from the population of 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations that file with the IRS, including geocoded data on organizations? communities and external environment that are publicly available from Census and other sources. Third, the NORPP Manager will serve as a collaborative repository to manage a bank of core and supplemental questionnaires to facilitate replication studies, improve content validity of measurements, and allow for consistent measurement scales across nonprofit organizational research. This work will increase the efficiency of research on nonprofit organizations by significantly reducing the costs to sample, contact, and survey nonprofit organizations, and to merge those data with existing data with the goal of facilitating the growth of rigorous, data-intensive research across the many social science disciplines that intersect with nonprofit organizational research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since its inception in 1949, the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF) has developed and transformed information systems to facilitate the efficient retrieval of information on cultures of the world so that researchers from many different disciplines could arrive at better understanding of human behavior in all its variety. New semantic and data mining infrastructure developed by this project will assist in determining universal and cross-cultural aspects of a wide range of user selected topics, such as social emotion and empathy, economics, politics and use of space and time. The database can serve to examine the range of possibilities for human thought, knowledge, belief and behavior with respect to real-world problems faced today, such as: climate change; violence; disasters; epidemics; hunger; and war. Examining how and why cultures vary in similar circumstances is critical to improving policy, applied science, and basic scientific understandings of the human condition. Such knowledge is extremely valuable in understanding an increasingly globalized world. <br/><br/>This project will develop advanced methods of working with text that can be applied from an extensible framework that deploys tools for analysis and retrieval. This services framework will be available for beginners and advanced researchers. Some methods can be applied in areas as far afield as AI and robotics, making AI solutions more human. Pattern extraction and linguistic analysis will be applied through AI tools to define a flexible logic for the contents of the documents. The project will result in: 1) improved relevance of search results though identifying finer grained topics in each paragraph in addition to the existing semantic tags; 2) establishing semantic links between the paragraphs in the database so that a researcher can follow topic trails more effectively; and 3) tools for management, analysis, visualization, and summarization of results, user initiated data mining and pattern identification. These will assist researchers identifying and testing hypotheses about the societies they investigate.

Researchers studying how people communicate can easily obtain many examples of written material.  Written material is also easy to analyze because it is easy to scan it for computer use or to download it from the Internet.  It is far more difficult to do research on spoken language because it is much harder to record speech and convert those recordings into a format a computer can use, especially speech that occurs in natural situations such as a family conversation around a dinner table or an argument between children in a classroom.  This project will build a new system that will let researchers and students examine recorded conversations and provide additional data about details of those conversations, such as the talkers? emotions, that cannot otherwise be measured.<br/><br/>The new system to be built will be part of the TalkBank system at Carnegie Mellon University, the largest publicly accessible databank for the study of spoken language in the world.  TalkBank includes audio and video recordings from children, classrooms, bilinguals, second language learners, and persons with language disorders in 34 different languages, together with written transcripts of those recordings.  The new system will allow scientists and researchers to study human communication by looking at patterns of speech in individual conversations, which is a level of detailed analysis that is not currently possible.  Studying communication at the conversation level is important because fine details in speech patterns can help answer important questions such as how people resolve confusion and misunderstandings as a conversation unfolds.  The new system will be based on a concept called Collaborative Commentary, which allows research groups and students to add comments about important conversation details, such as talkers? motivations, directly into the database by adding links to the conversation transcript.  This same system will also permit users to provide comments on media that has not yet been transcribed and create new transcripts through a web browser interface.

If the disruption is minor, like a flat tire, recovery is easy. If the disruption is major, recovery may be more difficult. For example, the shutdowns caused by the COVID pandemic forced doctors, nurses, and other clinical staff to find new ways to care for their patients.  This research will  use this example to study the effects of disruptions on healthcare routines. The expectation is that routines will ?bounce back? from minor disruptions, but the effects of major disruptions are more difficult to predict. After major disruptions, some routines may return to normal, while others may not.   <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to discover basic mechanisms that influence stability and change in routines.  To understand what makes some routines stronger than others, the effects of the COVID pandemic will be studied in four medical fields at the University of Rochester Medical Center: dermatology, orthopedics, oncology, and cardiology.  Data from electronic health records will be used to study the effects of shutdowns and other kinds of disruptions, such as changes in software and billing codes. Tools from network science will be used to model routines as patterns of action. These methods will allow comparisons to be made between patterns of action before and after a disruption with great precision. The extent to which the strength of a routine depends on the structure of the action pattern itself will be examined.  Data will be produced on outpatient clinical routines during the COVID-19 pandemic along with  a variety of materials to communicate the findings with a broader audience. Ultimately, this research will lead to a better understanding of how institutional routines can be made more reliable and effective in the face of disasters large and small.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Across a wide range of domains, such as healthcare, childcare, education, job training, and many others, nonprofit organizations serve the public, reduce the costs of government, and improve daily lives. Millions of individuals interact with nonprofit organizations every day. Yet despite these important roles, the high costs of collecting and sharing data have prevented a greater understanding of nonprofit organizations and their collective contributions to society. This project, the Nonprofit Organization Research Panel Project (NORPP) Manager, will create a publicly-accessible, internet-based, and collaborative research platform that will lower the costs of collecting and sharing large amounts of high-quality, multiyear data on nonprofits and their impacts. The platform will strengthen research and evaluation, broaden access to data-intensive research, and lead to more scientifically informed decision-making by organizations, policymakers, and funders and to improved outcomes for the communities they serve.<br/><br/>The NORPP platform will offer three primary functions. First, tools and automated processes will allow researchers to recruit and grow representative samples of nonprofit organizations nationally and across communities, states, and regions over time using a common methodology. The platform will automate systematic sampling and weighting procedures to ensure representativeness for studies using the platform, and it will reduce other costs to researchers by automating information flows with organizations in its samples. It will also allow public access among the research and practice communities to download nationally representative data, build additional project-specific samples within the platform, add original survey instruments, and collect original data. Second, the NORPP Manager will support the merger of data developed within the platform with IRS Form 990 Data and other available data on organizations from the population of 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations that file with the IRS, including geocoded data on organizations? communities and external environment that are publicly available from Census and other sources. Third, the NORPP Manager will serve as a collaborative repository to manage a bank of core and supplemental questionnaires to facilitate replication studies, improve content validity of measurements, and allow for consistent measurement scales across nonprofit organizational research. This work will increase the efficiency of research on nonprofit organizations by significantly reducing the costs to sample, contact, and survey nonprofit organizations, and to merge those data with existing data with the goal of facilitating the growth of rigorous, data-intensive research across the many social science disciplines that intersect with nonprofit organizational research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In social systems, interactions frequently influence individual behavior and beliefs which can, in turn, impact interactions. Specific variants of this type of coevolutionary phenomenon include opinion dynamics, voter behavior, observational learning, herding or flocking, and polarization. Network-based models are natural for representing such phenomena, and relevant work can be found in both the mathematical and statistical literatures (among others). However, coevolving network models are substantially less well-developed than models for networks of other types (e.g., static networks) and they are more complex to analyze and understand. This project will develop a model class that integrates central elements of the mathematical and statistical coevolving network modeling literatures. The models will be used to examine polarization in two online social network data sets, Twitter for Congress and Reddit. The project will involve a collaboration between statistical, mathematical, political, and computational social scientists. Graduate students will receive cross-disciplinary training in these areas. Publicly available software will be developed.<br/><br/>This research project will develop a general new class of coevolving latent space network with attractors (CLSNA) models for social systems.  The development of the CLSNA model class will result in a new type of causal modeling framework, explicitly combining dynamical systems modeling from mathematics with hierarchical modeling and inference from statistics. The former will allow the investigators to incorporate mathematically precise notions of social dynamics, like attraction and repulsion. The latter will permit computationally tractable and theoretically supported methods for statistical inference. In this project, the investigators will: (i) develop the modeling and statistical inference methodology for CLSNA models, with an emphasis on flocking and polarization; (ii) study the resulting behaviors allowed by this class, through a combination of both numerical and mathematical techniques; and (iii) assess empirically in online social media data the nature and extent of specific coevolutionary behaviors using these models. The models to be developed will be general and quite broadly applicable.

Many of us use it daily -- to dictate text messages on smart phones or to navigate automated phone systems. As good as these systems are, humans still outperform them in complex, crowded, and noisy acoustic environments. If more were known concerning how humans adapt to these challenging situations, speech technology might be made more adaptive and robust. For example, computer systems for speech recognition use complex ""deep learning"" networks that often need to be trained in ways that are very different from how humans learn language. Although neural network models aimed at simulating human language processing are much simpler, which allows scientists to develop hypotheses about how human language processing works, they don't use real speech as input. Instead, they use phonetic features that are more like text than speech and so fail to address the core problem of how humans map the acoustics of speech to words. This research program focuses on bridging the gap between the complex artificial neural network models used in current technologies for speech recognition and the simpler neural network models used to investigate how humans actually perceive speech.<br/><br/>This research program builds on a new neural network model for speech that aims to achieve high recognition accuracy on many words produced by several speakers. Crucially, the model can do this with minimal complexity (using many fewer layers than commercial speech recognition systems), which allows researchers to understand the computations it performs. The research plans include extending the model to a large vocabulary, training on naturalistic speech, and adding biologically plausible preprocessing modeled on the human auditory pathways. The model will be compared with key aspects of human spoken word recognition behavior as well as with human neural responses to spoken speech. The work has the potential to generate new insights to advance speech technology by making it more robust in challenging environments, with potential impact on speech technology used for health, law, education, and the automatic captioning that makes speech accessible to the deaf and hard of hearing. In addition, individuals ranging from high school students to Ph.D. students will be part of the research team and will have rich research experiences that will promote development of technical skills useful for careers in academic research or a variety of non-academic careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Those networks are composed of numerous intense bonds, including those between family members, friends, co-workers, neighbors, and many others. People are fundamentally interested in knowing where others sit in their real-world social networks. Discovering ?degrees of separation? and knowing who is especially well-connected consumes significant attention. The cognitive demands of tracking relationships in such networks, and calibrating one?s behavior accordingly, are likely to have been a driving force in human brain evolution. Additionally, the human capacity for understanding social networks is central to many aspects of everyday functioning, including interpersonal trust, empathy, and social influence. Yet, little is known about how the human brain encodes the structure of the social networks in which it is embedded, or how this knowledge shapes downstream mental processing and behavior. This project seeks to understand how knowledge of others? positions in one?s social network shapes thoughts, feelings, and behavior. The research considers individual differences in attunement to this information, and how context shapes representations of social networks. The related educational and training components of the project include the creation of mentored research and professional development opportunities for underrepresented students from community colleges and the development of a new graduate course focused on advanced methods in social neuroscience. <br/><br/>This project integrates approaches from social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and social network analysis to illuminate how knowledge of social networks shapes affect, behavior, and cognition. Several studies examine the social networks of a series of bounded communities. Subsets of community members complete behavioral and/or neuroimaging experiments that seek to delineate (1) the behavioral, cognitive, and affective consequences of knowledge of others? positions in one?s social network, and (2) how the mental representation of such knowledge varies across contexts and individuals. One specific focus is on how perceptions of distance in social networks and network centrality influences prosocial behavior. The results of the research will inform broader efforts to better understand social influence and interpersonal trust. Understanding these phenomena will also inform efforts in the national security community to mitigate the targeted spread of misinformation in social networks.

If the disruption is minor, like a flat tire, recovery is easy. If the disruption is major, recovery may be more difficult. For example, the shutdowns caused by the COVID pandemic forced doctors, nurses, and other clinical staff to find new ways to care for their patients.  This research will  use this example to study the effects of disruptions on healthcare routines. The expectation is that routines will ?bounce back? from minor disruptions, but the effects of major disruptions are more difficult to predict. After major disruptions, some routines may return to normal, while others may not.   <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to discover basic mechanisms that influence stability and change in routines.  To understand what makes some routines stronger than others, the effects of the COVID pandemic will be studied in four medical fields at the University of Rochester Medical Center: dermatology, orthopedics, oncology, and cardiology.  Data from electronic health records will be used to study the effects of shutdowns and other kinds of disruptions, such as changes in software and billing codes. Tools from network science will be used to model routines as patterns of action. These methods will allow comparisons to be made between patterns of action before and after a disruption with great precision. The extent to which the strength of a routine depends on the structure of the action pattern itself will be examined.  Data will be produced on outpatient clinical routines during the COVID-19 pandemic along with  a variety of materials to communicate the findings with a broader audience. Ultimately, this research will lead to a better understanding of how institutional routines can be made more reliable and effective in the face of disasters large and small.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, people can learn that snow is cold through touch and that sparrows fly through sight. But analyses of language reveal that a large amount of information about the world is contained within the structure of language itself. That is, by tracking which words occur with which other words, it is possible to learn things that seem to require direct experience. Moreover, the co-occurrence of words in different languages seems to reflect somewhat different bodies of knowledge. The project's principal aim is to 1) explore the scope of semantic knowledge embedded in the structure of different languages and 2) understand the extent to which people use this embedded information to learn about the world. Our educational systems depend on the ability to transmit knowledge via language in both its spoken and written forms. Understanding the kinds of semantic knowledge typically learned through language can help reveal the consequences of inequities in language exposure, such as those caused by reading difficulties.<br/><br/>To understand the relationship between people?s knowledge and information embedded in the structure of different languages, the investigators will compile a corpus of semantic features and generic statements from native speakers of eight languages: English, French, German, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, and Russian. They will then compare this information, generated by people, to information automatically derived from the distributional structure of each of the eight languages. This will allow them to determine whether cross-linguistic differences in people?s knowledge are predicted from differences in the information embedded in the different languages. The investigators will estimate the causal impact of language on people?s semantic knowledge using a quasi-experimental approach, rather than the more typical correlational analyses. The data will be compiled into a user-friendly, large-scale data resource (all with open source code and data) and integrated with existing multilingual text resources. The multilingual feature norms and ratings of generic statements will be an important resource for artificial intelligence and NLP research and may help identify sources of biases in training sets used in machine learning. This approach brings computational and empirical methods to the study of one of the oldest of human questions: how do we know what we know?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A cognitive model is a set of equations or a computer program that can mimic how people act in experimental or real-world settings. These models are useful in many ways. They can predict how people or groups will act in new situations. They can guide development of educational materials and training systems that maximize learning. They can give insight into the inner workings of the mind, which can contribute to treatment of psychological and brain disorders. They can help to explain human intelligence and creativity, leading to new methods in artificial intelligence and machine learning. This project aims to further these goals through mathematical advances and human behavioral experiments that together may lead to new, more accurate models. A variety of interdisciplinary collaborations and outreach efforts will then explore application of these models to improving psychiatric diagnosis, developing new analysis methods for neuroimaging data, making artificial intelligence more comprehensible to the user (explainable AI), and making psychological models, statistics, and AI more accessible to undergraduate and high school students.<br/><br/>The technical portion of this project investigates connections between two types of cognitive models: algorithmic and rational. Algorithmic models describe the mind in terms of information processing, specifying mental representations and the processes that act on them in going from perceptual input to observed behavior. Rational models explain a person?s learning and decision making in terms of his or her goals and beliefs about the how the world works. They assume the mind is highly tuned to its environment, and thus that it acts optimally relative to the inherent uncertainty in the world. Researchers usually think of algorithmic models as heuristics (i.e., simplified shortcuts) that approximate rational ones. Under this interpretation of algorithmic models, cognition falls short of being optimal because of physical limitations of the brain, such as how much it can remember or how much information it can process at once. This project will develop a different connection. Using formal mathematical analysis, the investigators will show how influential algorithmic models in psychology exactly match certain rational models under the assumption that the world is extremely uncertain and unpredictable. This connection will be used in several ways to develop new models: more sophisticated rational versions of existing algorithmic ones, more efficient algorithmic versions of existing rational ones, and intermediate models that combine the strengths of rational and algorithmic ones. Four series of experiments, each spanning tasks of decision making, reward learning, and concept acquisition, will test which models best predict human behavior, and also which yield the best objective performance in natural settings. If successful, the project will yield new mathematical foundations for the field of cognitive modeling, specific models that more accurately match human behavior, new tools for AI and statistics, and a new perspective on foundational questions of rationality of the human mind.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Networks influence all domains of society, including the diffusion of information and misinformation, the contagion of illness, the passage of legislation, the emergence and maintenance of norms, and the formation of close relationships. In many cases, these networks can be difficult to analyze because they contain so many relationships, and because the strength of these relationships is unknown. Backbone extraction involves identifying and retaining only the most important relationships, which yields a simpler network that can be more readily analyzed and visualized. In this project, in addition, the widely employed backbone software is extended to include these newly developed methods so that researchers can use them easily. This work facilitates the analysis of networks that arise in many different contexts and are studied in many different fields. It also involves the development of training materials to guide researchers in the selection of backbone methods.<br/><br/>Development of methods for extracting the backbone from unweighted networks proceeds in three stages.  First, the common steps involved in existing backbone extraction methods are identified. Next, each of these steps is implemented into a new function in the backbone package for R. This function allows for the application of both existing backbone models and new backbone models described by novel recombinations of common steps.  Finally, the performance of each existing and each new backbone model is evaluated by extracting the backbone from simulated dense unweighted networks that have been embedded with hidden community or hub structures. Once the most promising backbone models are identified, their software implementations are refined for scalability, allowing them to be applied to large networks. Additionally, software documentation and training materials are prepared that provide guidance to researchers using backbone models and the associated backbone package.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rather than a few central outlets (TV channels, newspapers) acting as a common and external frame of reference, many now derive their information through interaction on social platforms. Therefore, the dynamics of opinion formation have become more self-organized where large scale behaviors emerge as a result of local interactions without a central authority, similar to a flock of birds or a shoal of fish. But how are opinions formed in social networks? Is the structure of social networks a reaction of the users' opinions or does the network shape the users' opinions? One of the key motivations for this project is the following paradox: while the use of social media has supposedly increased the connectivity among individuals, opinions have become more polarized; homophilic ""echo chambers"" appear to be a ubiquitous feature of the structure of social media. These observed behaviors call for a close examination of the interplay between social media interaction and the dynamics of opinion formation at scale in order to better understand the rise of polarization and echo chambers. This project will also provide research and mentorship opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>As an emergent behavior, the underlying dynamics of opinion formation is unknown and cannot be derived from physical principles. Thus, the framework developed in this project is interdisciplinary at its core and combines both mathematical modeling (dynamical systems, graph theory) and data acquisition and analysis (natural language processing, sentiment analysis, clustering algorithms). This project will investigate novel dynamical systems modeling the interplay between a graph and a system of opinions. The aim is to characterize conditions resulting in polarization, consensus, or a transition between these two states. Then, experimental data will be extracted from the major social media platforms using a variety of data capture techniques. The resulting measurements will allow for an investigation of how the network structure of social media and the distribution of its user's opinions change overtime, providing insight into the interplay between these two dynamics. The ultimate goal is to refine the modeling pursuit with experimental data in order to investigate what is driving the observed trend towards polarization. Finally, using models validated with empirical data, the project will investigate various strategies aimed at reducing polarization and enhancing the natural flow of various opinions within a large audience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Project INSIGHT addresses two sets of questions about behavioral responses to social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) How does compliance with isolation policies drive disease mitigation outcomes? and (2) Does social isolation lead to unanticipated negative social outcomes, and if so, how?  Social isolation and individual distancing are key tools in mitigating large-scale infectious disease outbreaks. Yet, social interactions are crucial for the health and prosperity of individuals and their communities. Social isolation is associated with negative outcomes such as substance use and abuse, domestic violence, and reduced mental and physical health. These negative effects are often pronounced in rural, low-income, and older communities. The primary goal of INSIGHT is to model both positive and negative effects and thereby improve our understanding of the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and its long-term effect on society.  This project is funded jointly by the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and the Division of Social and Economic Sciences (SES) and the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences (BCS) in the Directorate of Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE).<br/><br/>Project INSIGHT develops realistic epidemic models incorporating behavioral responses of compliance and adherence as follows: (1) Isolation compliance. Using a classical segmentation of populations into compliant and non-compliant groups, a switching function is defined to account for changes in behavior. Games with appropriate payoff functions that inform individuals? behavioral choices are used. (2) Opioid misuse treatment adherence. A model according to severity of substance use disorder is created, implementing treatment adherence with game-derived utility functions and incorporating drug-seeking behavior of affected individuals, Model parameters like recovery and deaths are accounted for via well-defined behavioral functions. (3) Domestic violence. Focusing on intimate partners, economic-dependent functions are used to capture partners? choices such as abuse, forgiveness, seeking help, or leaving the domestic violence cycle. The modeling efforts use data from several national and local sources. The outcome of Project INSIGHT modeling efforts is a synthetic, in-depth view of the balance of positive (reduction of disease transmission) and negative (substance abuse, domestic violence) implications of social isolation as a response to pandemic situations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will use our understanding of how infants experience the world in their first years of life in order to develop new methods of training artificial intelligence programs to decode information they receive from a camera. One advantage that children have over computers is that they experience the visual world as a journey through space, rather than as a series of randomly collected, unrelated images. Children thus have a way to evaluate the similarity of two visual scenes based on the child's vantage point for each scene.  The investigators will generate highly realistic scenes modeled on the perspective of a young child moving through a house, which will be used to develop a computer algorithm that learns how to recognize objects, surfaces, and other visual concepts. The work will provide new insights into improving computer vision for real-world problems, a field that is under rapid growth due to its application in areas including household robots, assistive robots, and self-driving cars. The project will support interdisciplinary graduate and postdoctoral training as well as production of widely accessible STEM educational resources through Neuromatch, which is a summer school that emerged during the pandemic as a way to reach students while incurring minimal cost and maintaining a low carbon footprint.   <br/><br/>The investigators develop a critical theory of visual learning, inspired by how human children learn, with the potential to reshape the fundamentals of learning in computer vision and machine learning. The research hypothesizes that a key ingredient in human visual learning is spatiotemporal contiguity, which is the fact that images in the world are experienced in a sequence as a child moves through space. The project has two components aimed at ultimately developing a new algorithm for visual learning based on human learning. First, a data set will be created using ray-tracing to generate sequences of photorealistic images in a similar way that a child would experience them. Then, these images will be coupled with recent innovations in self-supervised deep learning to determine how spatiotemporal image sequences can augment computer vision using image classification and other tasks as tests. The resulting algorithm will produce artificial neural networks that respond to visual patterns. Those responses can be compared with the responses of neural networks in the human brain as measured through fMRI to determine through representational-similarity analysis if the sequence-learning mechanism is a better approximation of human visual learning than state-of-the-art computer vision methods. Moreover, this analysis technique can be used as a searchlight to highlight the regions in the brain that are most similar to the newly developed artificial neural networks; this is helpful for determining how different brain areas contribute to visual learning.

Bias is measured and corrected by comparing MD to data from a survey of people who voluntarily share their mobility information. Once corrected, deep learning techniques can extract measurements of mobility patterns related to social equity: racial and socioeconomic segregation, economic development, and climate resilience.

These data are an essential resource to study how people move and interact in society. However, these data are also very complex, so very few scientists have the technical skills to work with them. There are also privacy or data ownership issues that require scientists to have permission to access them. For these reasons, policymakers, practitioners, and the people in the communities that the data describe do not use them despite their importance. This award supports the creation of Mobility Data for Communities (MD4C), an infrastructure project that converts MD into a series of useful measures that describe mobility across a region's neighborhoods and places within those neighborhoods. These measures are accessible to everyone, including researchers, policymakers, and practitioners.   <br/>   <br/>MD4C?s tools are designed to resolve biases in the measures that result from not having certain people (for example, the elderly or unhoused who use cell phones less frequently) or having too many other people (for example, younger professionals who use cell phones all day) in the datasets. Bias is measured and corrected by comparing MD to data from a survey of people who voluntarily share their mobility information. Once corrected, deep learning techniques can extract measurements of mobility patterns related to social equity: racial and socioeconomic segregation, economic development, and climate resilience. The MD4C platform makes these bias-adjusted mobility measurements accessible for researchers and others and makes new research possible across the social sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Global trade can provide foods at lower prices, supply more types of foods year-round, and resist local supply shortages, such as crop failures. At the same time, global trade has drawbacks and can pose a risk to food security. For example, environmental disasters can create supply shortages that are passed on to importing countries or nutritious foods can be redirected away from domestic markets. Seafood is an important source of nutrition around the world and is among the most highly traded foods. As a result, it is important to understand when global seafood trade either improves or threatens food and nutrition security. This grant will support the construction of a database that will track the flows of products in the global seafood market. The database will include information on the kinds of seafood that are being traded across countries, who is selling it and who is buying it, and how this network of buyers and sellers changes over time. <br/> <br/>This project will construct the Aquatic Resource Trade in Species (ARTIS) database which will show the global flow of seafood species for the first time. This database will enable research on the environmental and human outcomes of food system globalization, including a better understanding of the conditions under which trade promotes environmental sustainability, human health, and food security. Research in these areas has been limited by missing data and, for the data that exist, mismatches in the taxonomic and product resolution of the data. The ARTIS database will use techniques of optimization to align public data sets. These linked datasets will be joined to new data on the nutrient content of different kinds of seafood. ARTIS will be available to researchers by publishing the underlying data and code, archiving the data and code with a downloadable R package, and development of an interactive website that will allow users to explore the seafood trade without downloading data or requiring coding skills. The ARTIS database will be important for answering pressing questions about the role of global seafood trade in sustainable food production and nutrition security.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We lack comparable cross-national data that can help us to understand how these threats operate across countries, and how political institutions, cyber-infrastructure, and socio-economic context shape such threats. We also lack comprehensive data about candidate social media behavior. This project will dramatically increase scholars' access to data on electoral candidates' social media behavior and how voters respond to this behavior. This work will allow currently impossible investigations of how false information travels online during electoral campaigns and how such information affects beliefs of average voters across a range of polities facing different stages of democratic expansion. These data can also inform governments interested in securing their elections and can assist social media firms in understanding how their platforms are used during campaigns.<br/><br/>This project is focused on building a data resource for scholars from social media data collection surrounding upcoming elections in polarized, democratizing, and otherwise relatively unstable contexts. The research team is purposively sampling election contexts of candidate social media data collection that meet objective criteria based on their level of democracy, polarization, stability, and cyber infrastructure. Across all of these contexts, the research team is compiling social media candidate data, including candidate (public) social media accounts, publicly available candidate background characteristics, and other variables capturing the national, election, and seat(s) context. In three of these contexts, the research team is executing a survey among voters, collecting data on voters' ability to access candidates' online messages, voters' attitudes towards candidates' social media activity, the extent to which candidates mobilize offline political activity (including election violence) through digital networks, how commonly and effectively politicians spread disinformation using online platforms, and voters' perceptions of the security and stability of political cyberspace in their context.

Why are increasing numbers of people struggling to form and maintain social ties? Connecting with others takes time, energy, and sometimes money. These resources are limited, so people must decide which friendships, if any, are worth the investment. Should they join a club to make new friends? Or should they focus their time, energy, and money on strengthening their existing friendships? And how should they invest their time and energy during a conversation ? by making small talk or delving deeper into a new topic? The answer depends on a person?s personality and goals. But it also depends on the context: for instance, whether a person is new to the community, how much turnover there is in the community, and whether the community is rich in resources or suffering from scarcity. This research asks if people adjust their social connection strategies to optimally fit the context. A mismatch between a person?s environment and the selected approach to socializing might increase the risk of becoming social disconnected. The findings are expected to inform future interventions aimed at reducing loneliness and improving the health of communities.<br/><br/>The current project examines how context influences people?s decisions to explore new opportunities in social connections versus exploit existing ones. Seven studies measure and manipulate social constraints in a given context to determine a) how people choose interaction partners, b) how they choose conversation topics, and c) the psychosocial consequences of social exploration and exploitation. Each study examines social behavior in a different context, including a computer game with hypothetical social partners, a classroom with peers, an online chatroom, a video call, and daily life on a college campus. The research combines controlled experiments and agent-based modeling with naturalistic behaviors captured by crowd tracking, mobile sensing, and topic analysis. Integrating the interdisciplinary explore-exploit framework with social psychology advances an understanding of the causes and consequences of everyday social choices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although management strategies and adaptation have been examined in many case studies, systematic analysis that can add up to fundamental insight has been limited. To fill this gap, this project undertakes a big-data, hypothesis-driven, assessment of the sensitivity of a variety of socio-environmental systems to historical fluctuations in climate across the continental United States. The analytical challenge is to do this empirically, with evidence from diverse sources, across multiple sectors, at high resolution, and at the national scale. By contrasting systems under different management intensities experiencing similar climate conditions, this research expects to constrain changes in system sensitivity due to management. The project thus bridges theoretical approaches from the biophysical, social, and information sciences in ways that can be used to evaluate the effects of climate variability and change, the effectiveness of adaptations in the U.S. economy, and strategies for sustainability under changing conditions. <br/><br/> Streamflow, vegetation, and wildfire dynamics are interconnected through water and energy limits and demands which are, in turn, regulated by climate. Management goals for water resources, agricultural productivity, and hazard mitigation ultimately aim to minimize the impact of disturbances on water availability, food production, and safety. Adaptation strategies typically focus on minimizing sensitivity to climate fluctuations, albeit in ways constrained by cost, technology, and competing needs across systems. This project will leverage the climatological diversity and long history of management and adaptation in the contiguous United States to conduct a big-data, hypothesis-driven analysis for how the strength of coupling between climate and socio-environmental systems varies as a function of management intensity. The conceptual framework for analyzing and interpreting the effects of management is based on complex-systems theory, whereby impact can be viewed as an emergent property. The degree of coupling between climate and systems under contrasting styles and intensities of management can be characterized as the sensitivity of system indicators (streamflow, reservoir levels, vegetation productivity, wildfire, crop yields, and economic activity) to changes in the statistical properties of the climate forcing (mean, variance, entropy, and determinism), and quantify it with dose-response functions. Results will be used to identify natural experiments where comparisons between heavily- managed systems adjacent to those that are managed minimally can constrain how management and adaptation affect system sensitivity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The resulting exchange of genetic material means that the modern human gene pool includes a small amount of Neanderthal genetic variation.  In this project, researchers will examine how Neanderthal genetic variants that are present in living humans affect the degree to which a nearby gene is active, in a variety of different human cell types (e.g., skin cells, immune cells, liver cells, skeletal cells). Through the identification of functional variants and by the dissemination of such data to the public, the researchers will advance research and public understanding of the effects of evolutionary history and genetic variation on living human biology. The findings will help to characterize the functional and medical impacts of Neanderthal DNA sequences on human cell function. The investigators will also work with museums to develop exhibits that will highlight the practical importance of this field of research. Furthermore, this project will promote broader participation of women and underrepresented scholars in STEM research through student training and mentoring activities. <br/><br/>Given recent advances in high throughput functional testing, the researchers will conduct experiments in which they investigate tens of thousands of Neandertal genetic variants and their human counterparts for their ability to regulate the expression of genes in a variety of human cell types.

Despite the countless accounts of how this presumed guilt can start a chain reaction of confirmation bias that taints all stages of the criminal justice process, little is known about what triggers suspicion about the innocent person in the first place. Drawing from existing and to-be-created databases, the overarching goal of this project is to identify and understand what demographic, behavioral, and linguistic factors initially spark suspicion and trigger dangerous confirmation bias processes leading to false convictions. We focus on one of the earliest moments in which a person might become a suspect: when they call 911. A key hypothesis is that when witnesses? behaviors violate expectations, people ?morally typecast? the witness as less capable of being a victim and more capable of being a perpetrator. Increasing basic understanding on how these expectations are formed, how they are violated, and how they interact with witnesses? gender and race, is a critical step towards predicting whether callers are ultimately charged with the crime they are reporting. Moreover, understanding how these processes emerge will be critical in developing state-of-the-art curriculum to educate police about their expectations? accuracy and consequences, and to educate attorneys on defending clients they believe to be innocent. Given the serious consequences that false convictions have on both innocent individuals and the public trust in the criminal justice system at large, the project?s focus has broad societal impact by systematically investigating the source of detectives? misguided ?hunches? that have anecdotally led to false convictions.   <br/><br/>This study employs a variety of data-driven methods to identify predictors of suspicion and being charged with the crime one is reporting. First, we will create a large corpus of real 911 calls to analyze linguistic and acoustic behavioral aspects of reporting a violent crime to see if laypeople and law enforcements? expectations are accurate. We will recruit lay people, police officers, 911 operators, and trauma clinicians to listen to these calls and report their impressions of the caller to identify what aspects of reporting a violent crime generates suspicion and predicts actually becoming a suspect in the crime. We will identify psychological explanations for these effects as well as factors that might moderate these effects, such the caller?s race and gender. Across studies, we will use indirect, data-driven ways of assessing what makes people suspicious without imposing the researchers? hypotheses on the design, such as using natural language processing machine-learning models. We will also test downstream consequences of witnesses? emotion expression in a 911 call for the likelihood of being falsely convicted at trial for the crime they reported. Finally, we will quantitatively code cases of known innocence (exoneree case files) for what sparked suspicion about the innocent person, focusing on mentions of their behavior seeming ?unusual?.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This grant will expand the structure of cyberSW to include data on individual households within some of these villages, using information similar to that collected by the US Census. The US Census collects information such as wealth, cultural background, and number of people from a particular address or neighborhood. This project will collect similar data from ancient households and neighborhoods using the artifacts and architecture they left behind. In addition, links between households, neighborhoods and settlements will be explored through time. Because cyberSW currently provides data only about settlements, expanding the database to include households and neighborhoods within settlements will allow new research on how Indigenous peoples lived before the Spanish arrived.   <br/><br/>Under the guidance of Tribal members, cyberSW will be expanded to include information about rooms, trash deposits, and other household features. This will make it easier to study how households and their networks changed over long periods of time. The project will develop a variety of network analyses and metrics from household architecture and associated artifacts, and make these analyses and metrics available through the online science gateway. This gateway will include a chronology tool that dates and groups artifacts and households to reconstruct neighborhoods and networks at different points in time. Using this interface and other tools, scientists, Tribal members, and the public will be able to explore ancient Indigenous settlements without compromising actual site locations. People will gain insight into the different social groups who lived in these villages. They will also be able to explore how households and villages interacted with one another. Importantly, it will be possible to download data in formats and at scales useful for other kinds of research. This will make cyberSW a great tool for geographers and other scientists who use census data to study households. It will also encourage researchers to cross disciplines and work together to learn about the past, present, and future of households.

Nevertheless, the effects of order on conflict and vice-versa are complex and poorly understood. Moreover, historical analogies that are used to aid policy decisions are overwhelmingly drawn from relationships in the Western world. This research takes a multidimensional approach to improving our understanding of the relationship between international order and conflict. To shed light on the mechanisms that connect order to conflict, the research team uses computational network models, derived from a broad array of historical cases, that connect the dynamics of state behavior to patterns of order at the level of the international system. To explore the utility of those models, the team develops new network measures of political order and systemic uncertainty and conducts cross-national survey research into the individual-level determinants of support for order. The project has several broader impacts: (1) it contributes to an improved understanding of the order-conflict relationship; (2) it further expands the geographic boundaries of the study of international order and support for order beyond the Western world; and (3) it provides a more concrete foundation for policy recommendations that meaningfully enhance national security.<br/><br/><br/>The goals of this research include the development of computational network models relating international order, domestic political order, and conflict; the extension of those models beyond the context of the Western World, specifically to incorporate Eastern understandings of order; the validation and calibration of those models on original, multi-country survey data; and the development of original network measures of order and uncertainty. These projects will give the research team a considerably better understanding of the implications of different configurations of international order for conflict, improve forecasts of political instability by adding an international dimension to our collective understanding of domestic instability, provide a better understanding of the implications for conflict of a non-Western international order, and provide foundational knowledge to underpin a foreign policy strategy designed to leverage international order to produce peace and mitigate instability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New forms of digital communication have fundamentally shifted the arenas and mechanics of public conversations. Widespread adoption of voting systems and user-managed communities on social media can create group processes that normalize and protect societally unacceptable ideas and behaviors. This grand shift begs for a research agenda on deviance with a new theoretical scope and empirical relevance. Drawing on linguistic and sociological theory and computational methods, the project will enhance our knowledge of the mechanisms and determinants of online deviant behavior and extremism.  Findings will serve the public interest by shedding light on governance decisions that affect behavior in online public spaces. <br/><br/>A complete conversation database of posts and comments from a large online information-sharing and discussion website will be used to investigate the empirical puzzle of divergence and polarization on digital platforms. The main theoretical aim is to understand a transition to deviant ideologies or behaviors within communities in which non-deviance is the norm and actively enforced by members. The central hypothesis is that deviant communities create localized conversations and incentive structures in which cultural meanings of deviant linguistic codes and extremist behaviors can be formed, shared, and enforced. The project will explore the conditions and processes of the transition by connecting micro-level conversation dynamics with macro-level ecological competition. Two specific questions will be addressed: 1) What conversational dynamics underlie the shifts in linguistic conventions, normative standards, and cultural interpretations of deviance? 2) How do inter-community interaction and exclusion contribute to group deviation and polarization? By simultaneously adjusting the lens at the conversational level and ecological level, the project aims to offer a set of middle-range theories explaining the emergence and solidification of deviant, and in certain cases extremist, behavior in online public spaces.

Microscopic wear traces present on the earliest (stone) tools excavated by archaeologists, offer key insights into how ancient people worked a variety of materials, like wood, skins, ivory, etc. Despite the enormous interpretive potential, archaeologists have experienced problems related to the difficulty and efficiency of securely identifying worked materials from wear traces, as well as reproducing each other?s results. This project will harness the power of tribology and artificial intelligence (AI) to advance understanding how wear patterns form and, at the same time, facilitate and democratize the identification process. Beside scientific publications, the investigators will produce an open-source tool for helping other researchers use their algorithms in their own work. The produced results will thus be useful to both the bio-engineering community as well as to archaeologists. To address pipeline issues in archaeological science, the project will increase diversity and the representation of minority groups by engaging high school students from New York City in the lab experiments.<br/><br/>The project seeks to solve a 70-year standing problem in archaeology: how does wear form on the surface of stone tools as a result of working different materials? Answering this question will generate predictions that will enable large-scale studies of archaeological wear to be carried out in the future. To tackle this problem, an interdisciplinary team of archaeologists, together with mechanical and bio-materials engineers will first catalogue the mechanical properties of natural worked materials, such as wood, ivory, skins, etc. The researchers will then build surrogate biomaterials isolating the role of these properties (such as hardness, elasticity, fracture toughness, etc.), so that their effect on wear formation can be tested individually in experiments. Each surrogate material will be rubbed against experimentally produced stone bits using a tribometer. The result will be a large collection of recorded wear patterns that can be causally correlated with worked material properties. In a second experiment, stone bits will be used in more realistic tasks using a force-controlled robot and organic target materials to generate a large collection of wear patterns that approximate archaeological wear. Information from both experiments will be used to train computers to classify archaeologically occurring wear patterns according to the materials they most likely came into contact with. Moreover, classification algorithms with and without expert input for identifying worked materials will be compared, which addresses the application of artificial intelligence in archaeology, a topic which is currently of great interest to archaeologists in general.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become clear that the US food-supply system is vulnerable. As the pandemic forced restaurants to close, or dramatically curtail operations, the news reported that farmers were discarding products because the buyers (restaurants) were no longer buying. At the same time consumers are struggling to find products in the supermarkets. Restaurant-supply networks may play a larger role in the resilience and sustainability of the US supply network than people had thought. It is clear now that these food distribution networks likely have evolved independently to maximize efficiency, not resiliency to risks such as pandemics. Recognizing this problem, and the potential impact on the economy, jobs, and national security, the US government has invested billions of dollars to buy and redistribute food that farmers were discarding. This research will pinpoint weak links in the food-supply network during the COVID-19 pandemic by rapidly assessing disruptions in restaurant-supply network, which include restaurateurs, distributors, and producers. The team?s novel spatial, ethnographic, networks (SENs) approach will also advance supply chain management theory by quantifying difficult-to-reach components within supply chains. The goal is to provide actionable strategies that can identify how people can adapt and help create a more resilient and sustainable US Food System amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and avoid these disruptions in future unanticipated events. Finally, the project?s novel SENs approach will train students in research methods that can be rapidly applied to tackle unexpected changes in our global food system. <br/><br/>Supply-chain scholars are calling for new theoretical developments that account for the complexities and dynamics, and provides visibility to hidden components in supply networks. This project will bridge the gap in knowledge through spatial, ethnographically-derived, networks (SENs). A multi-phase comparative research design is employed that allows the ability to maximize the comparison potential of the analysis along key dimensions: the onset and intensity of COVID-19 and the influence of regional supply distribution over time. The overall goal is to understand what are the structural and spatial characteristics of actors? (restaurateurs?, distributors?, and farmers?) supply networks that lead to various outcomes (e.g., new business opportunities, more sustainable practices, staying in business, or closing shop). Key informant interviews will be used to design structured interviews that will be conducted at two points in time. A number of measures will be derived from these survey spatially-explicit food supply networks for key informants, including a Sourcing Diversity Index that characterizes distributor typologies, geography, and ego network measures. By capturing these disruptions at the onset, and throughout the pandemic, this project will be able to identify key areas of the food-supply network that are vulnerable, not only for this pandemic, but other global disruptions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This work frequently requires merging multiple datasets over fine-grained sociopolitical categories (e.g., ethnicities, languages, religions, or provinces). However, different datasets often encode corresponding sociopolitical categories with different variable names, at different scales, and different points in.  These different encodings must be translated across datasets before merging, thereby creating a substantial bottleneck to interdisciplinary, comparative social science.  This project will build a new data analysis platform called SocioMap that will help overcome this bottleneck by providing tools for translating across a large and growing body of international social science datasets and for building new datasets from diverse existing datasets storing ethnic, religious, linguistic, and administrative boundaries in disparate, and non-compatible formats.<br/><br/>SocioMap will be a user-friendly set of tools to help translate sociopolitical categories and classification schemes across multiple, external datasets. This project will focus on four kinds of categories ? ethnicities, languages, religions, and administrative boundaries ? that are commonly used in social science research.  The beta version of SocioMap will be injected with a critical mass of these categories and translations between these categories across dozens of common standards and hundreds of demographic surveys and censuses worldwide. Furthermore, SocioMap is designed to grow by permitting registered users to add new categories and translations for re-use in future projects.  SocioMap?s tools will help users: (1) explore contextual information about specific sociopolitical categories, (2) translate and share categories from new datasets, standards, and published studies, (3) merge novel combinations of datasets for researchers? custom research needs, and (4) document key aspects of the analytical workflow that often go unreported and, in so doing, make analyses more reproducible. SocioMap complements existing observational datasets by providing tools for linking these datasets with social, cultural, and demographic data from a diverse and growing body of new datasets.  SocioMap?s capabilities will spur new interdisciplinary research, encourage new analyses of publicly funded data and re-assessments of the robustness and reproducibility of past findings.  It will also create a foundation for future work with other kinds of entities (e.g. political parties, non-governmental organizations, industry and occupation classifications, and firms) and for reconciling sociopolitical entities over longer historical periods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of us use it daily -- to dictate text messages on smart phones or to navigate automated phone systems. As good as these systems are, humans still outperform them in complex, crowded, and noisy acoustic environments. If more were known concerning how humans adapt to these challenging situations, speech technology might be made more adaptive and robust. For example, computer systems for speech recognition use complex ""deep learning"" networks that often need to be trained in ways that are very different from how humans learn language. Although neural network models aimed at simulating human language processing are much simpler, which allows scientists to develop hypotheses about how human language processing works, they don't use real speech as input. Instead, they use phonetic features that are more like text than speech and so fail to address the core problem of how humans map the acoustics of speech to words. This research program focuses on bridging the gap between the complex artificial neural network models used in current technologies for speech recognition and the simpler neural network models used to investigate how humans actually perceive speech.<br/><br/>This research program builds on a new neural network model for speech that aims to achieve high recognition accuracy on many words produced by several speakers. Crucially, the model can do this with minimal complexity (using many fewer layers than commercial speech recognition systems), which allows researchers to understand the computations it performs. The research plans include extending the model to a large vocabulary, training on naturalistic speech, and adding biologically plausible preprocessing modeled on the human auditory pathways. The model will be compared with key aspects of human spoken word recognition behavior as well as with human neural responses to spoken speech. The work has the potential to generate new insights to advance speech technology by making it more robust in challenging environments, with potential impact on speech technology used for health, law, education, and the automatic captioning that makes speech accessible to the deaf and hard of hearing.

One key contribution of the study will be a better understanding of why and how student and peer outcomes are related. The study aims to disentangle three kinds of influence: direct effects of students? friendships, indirect or ?ripple effects? on other students, and contextual effects of neighborhood and school composition. The study will contribute to sociological theories of stratification, social network analysis, and statistical research on endogeneity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In a social system, in which things spread from person to person, what spreads might be an epidemic, ideas and opinions, or radicalization and polarization. Understanding these kinds of processes is important for many reasons, including not only contributions to basic science but also the development of effective public policy and the preservation of national security.  This award provides funding for the conference ?Computational Approaches for Contagion on Complex Social Systems? (CACCSS). The conference promotes the exchange of ideas around novel computational tools for the modeling of contagion in complex social systems. The conference features speakers who will give talks on topics including epidemic modeling, misinformation spread, higher-order contagion, and behavioral models.  The conference is also dedicated to training participants on these topics and the use of software that facilitates the analysis of contagion data.<br/><br/>The workshop will promote the use of computational tools that will facilitate modeling of contagion in complex systems for researchers with a wide variety of backgrounds. The award subsidizes the travel of students, postdocs, and junior faculty to attend the workshop, and trains young researchers to contribute to this important area of research.  It supports accessibility and inclusion of researchers from underrepresented groups, and in so doing increases the diversity of researchers in this field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
